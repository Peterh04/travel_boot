            <h1 class="heading">Steps to planning your trip to Africa</h1>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Choose a destination: East Africa is your best bet for stunning wildlife and natural beauty. Southern Africa follows on the list. For a great experience with wildlife, choose Tanzania and for a great combination of wildlife, gorilla tracking, and nature beauty, choose Uganda.</li>

                <li>Decision making: Make a decision between guided travel of a self-drive safari experience. We highly recommend guide safaris for the best experience. You will learn a lot from your tour guide and go to places you would rather be afraid to travel to unguided. If you wish to drive your own adventure, www.roadtripafrica.com offers you a good 4X4 and all the camping gear you will need.
                
                For guided travel, its way easier to select from one of the set travel plans as displayed on travel sites and customize it to your liking. You can also tell your travel operator your favorite destination and you together tailor-make your holiday travels. Discuss your budget and make sure you fully assess what you get from the offer given to you. Good travel operators will always tell you about the nature of accommodation, activities, time, meals, and all exclusions in your budget. Make free inquiries by emailing <a class="paragraph-link" href="mailto:contact@travelbootholidays.com">contact@travelbootholiday.com</a>
                </li>

                <li>Select the best time for travel. You can always travel to Africa any time of the year but the best time for wildlife travel is July to November since this is a dry season. Since this is a peak season for East African safari travel, you have to book your Uganda gorilla tickets way in time for your trekking this season.</li>

                <li>Decide on how long you will stay in Africa.
                    Life in Africa is quite different from that in the Western world, there is plenty to see, do, and learn. Unless otherwise spend a week and more on your holiday. Save a bunch while enjoying your stay by volunteering (find out more here at <a   class ="paragraph-link" href="https://www.helpkidsuganda.com/">www.helpkidsuganda</a>.com) for Uganda volunteering, stay in an AIrB&B place or Backpackers Hotel, and do some cheap activities like city tours. Plan your stay with your tour operator and seek such information about the length of your stay.x</li>
                
                <li>Purchase a visa: in many African countries, the visa acquisition process is a very short one. You can either buy it online or at the airport. To avoid long queues on your arrival, we recommend you purchase the visa online. Please take caution on the duration of the visa, many African countries offer 3 months for tourist visas but some offer just one month. East Africa offers offers its visa at $100 which makes it a good deal for entry into all 5 East African countries.</li>

                <li>Book your air ticket: have your tour agent book a flight for you and we highly recommend direct flights or flights with few stops. Take caution on very cheap flights, some involve many stop-through countries that will require you to purchase a visa to pass through. See for information from your agent.</li>

                <li>Learn a bit about your African destination: your will have an amazing holiday when you are informed a bit about your destination. Great tour operators will always tell you more about the country and when you have questions within the chart, you will learn a lot. It's also wise to know what to do when the unexpected happens. You can always find your way through.</li>

                <li>Explore Uganda! We hope you will choose and recommend Uganda for its beauty, culture, wildfire, and safety.</li>
